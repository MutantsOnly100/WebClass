This project, completed by my team and me during our C# bootcamp in 2019, is a website designed for an online class system.

Project Concept:
WebClass is an online real-time learning platform that removes the barriers to education. There are no entrance exams and no restrictions based on age, education, or background. The platform allows amateur teachers from various professional fields to share their expertise, making it easier for both teachers and students to connect and learn without time constraints.

Service Objectives:

Enhance learning effectiveness and shorten the time needed to achieve educational goals.
Enable users to make the most of their time for personal growth and self-improvement.
Offer members the opportunity to generate passive income while building their personal brand.
Allow users to ask questions and interact with teachers via the comment section.
Keep users up-to-date with current knowledge trends through popular courses.
Analyze user course preferences in the backend to provide personalized and relevant learning recommendations.
